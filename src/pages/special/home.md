## Galleria Kasvihuone opening 2024

Once again Friction opened the season of the Galleria Kasvihuone project for this year. The project is a blend of art, research, education, fun and of course gardening! This year's installation will stay in its new place for two years, you can read more about the project here [http://galleriakasvihuone.fi](http://galleriakasvihuone.fi). We were honored to play a fun little roof terrace garden gig:
