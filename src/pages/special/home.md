## Kaapeli Jam hosted by Friction

Every first Friday of the month, we are now hosting an cumbia and afrobeat jam session at Cable Factory in Helsinki. We'll be opening the evening at 18:00 and from 18:30 the stage is open for anyone interested to play! You can read more about the event [here](https://cle-ment.github.io/friction-helsinki-website/jams/).

# Need some Friction in your life?

Embracing the vibrant rhythms of Afrobeat, the soulful melodies of Ethio-Jazz, and the lively beats of Cumbia, the Helsinki-based Friction collective crafts a unique, multicultural musical experience that transcends borders and unites audiences.

We welcome opportunities to bring our transcendent sounds to new audiences and venues. If you are inspired to feature our Helsinki-based ensemble at your event, creating moments that bridge worlds and evoke unity, please reach out to us. Let's orchestrate an unforgettable musical journey that captivates and connects.
