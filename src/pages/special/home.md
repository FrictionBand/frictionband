## Kaapeli Jam hosted by Friction

Every first Friday of the month, we are now hosting an cumbia and afrobeat jam session at Cable Factory in Helsinki. We'll be opening the evening at 18:00 and from 18:30 the stage is open for anyone interested to play! You can read more about the event [here](https://cle-ment.github.io/friction-helsinki-website/jams/).
