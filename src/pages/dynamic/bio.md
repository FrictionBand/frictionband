# About Friction

Helsinki based Friction has been performing in Finland's capital region for the better part of a decade, and this year they are engaged in an exciting new project which combines their mainstay afrobeat, jazz, and latin cumbia influenced repertoire with new musical flavours from the Near East and North Africa. It’s safe to say that the name Friction is more than a little tongue in cheek, as the group is a dynamically evolving collective: made up of passionate musicians, harmoniously blending diverse genres and cultural backgrounds. With up to a dozen musicians contributing, Friction has an expansive and layered sound, with a rich horn section, multiple percussionists, prominent electric guitars, and catchy basslines. There’s a lot going on but it’s all firmly rooted in a range of infectious grooves from around the world.

Together, the members and contributors of the Friction collective are pushing new boundaries, creating an innovative sound that is truly unique, and building a reputation as one of Helsinki’s more exciting live music offerings.
